# 2026 Strategic Hypothesis: "The Convexity Bridge"
> Status: Draft | Reviewer: CIO | Base Date: 2025-12-31

## 1. Executive Summary (The $14B Blueprint)
We are entering 2026 with a distinct **"Duration Mismatch"**.
* **The Gap**: 
    * **USD SSA**: Need to deploy **~$2.45bn** ($1.55bn Net New + $0.9bn Maturity).
    * **AUD Rates**: Need to deploy **~$1.62bn** (Net New).
* **The Core Conflict**:
    * Our USD book (Dur 2.45) is too short for a Fed cutting cycle (Hypothesis: Bull Steepening).
    * Our AUD book (Dur 5.74) is well-positioned but needs careful expansion without compressing the Spread over USD.

## 2. Portfolio Specific Strategy

### A. USD SSA (The Liquidity Anchor)
* **Target**: Grow from $4.45bn $\rightarrow$ **$6.0bn**
* **Constraint**: Tier 1 Names Only (IBRD, EIB, KFW, ADB).
* **Current State Diagnosis**:
    * **Duration Starvation**: W.Avg Duration of 2.45 is dangerously low. We are "Short Gamma" against a rally.
    * **The Maturity Cliff**: Feb & Apr 2026 maturities ($576MM combined) are creating a drag. The Apr maturity @ 3.07% is actually *accretive* to roll, but we need to extend.
* **Strategic Hypothesis (The Trade)**:
    * **"Extension Trade"**: We must direct the new $1.55bn + $0.9bn cashflow into the **5Y-7Y Belly** of the curve.
    * **Target Duration**: Lift portfolio duration from 2.45 $\rightarrow$ **4.0+**.
    * **Relative Value**: Monitor **Swap Spreads (ASW)**. If ASW tightens (Swap rate < Treasury Yield), SSAs become expensive vs UST. We buy when SSA spreads widen due to "Supply Indigestion" (typical in Jan/Feb).

### B. AUD Rates (The Macro Proxy)
* **Target**: Grow from $6.38bn $\rightarrow$ **$8.0bn**
* **Constraint**: Non-Credit (ACGB, SSA, Moderate Semis).
* **Current State Diagnosis**:
    * **Yield Parity Trap**: AUD Yield (4.18%) $\approx$ USD Yield (4.14%). Nominal carry pickup is zero.
    * **Rationale**: The allocation is purely for **Diversification (FX)** and **XCCY Basis Arbitrage**.
* **Strategic Hypothesis (The Trade)**:
    * **"The China Call"**: Betting on AUD is betting on China's 2026 recovery. We position in **ACGB 10Y** for maximum macro correlation.
    * **The Semi-Gov Picker**: To squeeze yield, we use the "Moderate Semi" allowance. Look for NSW/VIC spreads widening.
    * **XCCY Arbitrage**: *Crucial Check*. If USD/AUD Basis is negative (e.g., -20bps), we swap USD funding to AUD assets to generate synthetic pickup.

## 3. Quantitative Signals & Triggers

### 3.1 The Reinvestment Matrix (USD SSA)
| Maturity Bucket | Action Logic | Target Benchmark |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feb Maturity ($300m @ 4.10%)** | **Loss of Carry**. Must reinvest immediately to avoid NII drop. | Buy **5Y SSA** (Seek 4.0%+) |
| **Apr Maturity ($276m @ 3.07%)** | **Opportunity**. Rolling this low coupon into current market rates is P&L accretive. | Buy **7Y-10Y SSA** (Lock Duration) |
| **May Maturity ($100m @ 4.88%)** | **High Pain**. Losing a high coupon. Hard to replace. | Consider **Callable Structures** to enhance yield. |

### 3.2 The AUD Basis Monitor
* **Signal**: Monitor 5Y USD/AUD Cross-Currency Basis.
* **Trigger**:
    * If Basis < -15bps: Aggressively deploy into AUD SSA (hedged).
    * If Basis > 0bps: Stick to unhedged ACGB (pure macro bet).

## 4. Scenario Stress Tests (Pre-Trade Check)

* **Scenario A: "No Landing" (Rates Stay High)**
    * *Impact*: Short duration USD book outperforms. AUD Long duration hurts.
    * *Mitigation*: Keep USD purchases floating-rate (FRN) or short-dated if CPI > 3% in Q1 2026
